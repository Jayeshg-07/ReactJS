            Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in
            limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking right-handed
            middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in
            limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh,
            and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>December 23, 2004:</strong> Makes his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong. Is run out for
                0 after facing one ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>April 5, 2005:</strong> The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12,
                7* and 3, Dhoni is sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash 148
                off 123 balls with 15 fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's 356/9. The world wakes up
                to Dhoni's potential.
            </li>
            <li><strong>October 31, 2005:</strong> Dhoni stamps himself into the history books with a record 183*
                against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare.
                Batting at No 3, his 145-ball hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in the
                best-of-seven series.
            </li>
            <li><strong>September 13, 2007:</strong> Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is a wash out
                against Scotland in their ICC World Twenty20 opener. Few could have predicted how India's tournament
                will pan out.
            </li>
            <li><strong>September 24, 2007:</strong> India win the inaugural World Twenty20 by beating Pakistan in an
                absolute humdinger in Johannesburg. Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the landscape of T20
                cricket is changed forever.
            </li>
            <li><strong>October 2, 2007:</strong> In the next match in Kochi, Dhoni scores his first fifty as captain -
                58 off 88 balls - as India are beaten by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match series.
            </li>
            <li><strong>April 2, 2011:</strong> India win the World Cup after 28 years, with the skipper hitting the
                winning runs with a six. Promoting himself up the order, Dhoni shrugs off his poor run in the tournament
                with the innings of his life: 91* off 79 balls.
            </li>
            <li><strong>October 25, 2011:</strong> India salvage some pride with a 5-0 win over England when Alastair
                Cook's team visit. Dhoni is Player of the Series.
            </li>
            <li><strong>June 23, 2013:</strong> Dhoni marshals his troops superbly to lead India to a narrow five-run
                win in the final of the Champions Trophy over hosts England, thus becoming the first captain to hold all
                three of the ICC's major titles.
            </li>
            <li><strong>March 23, 2016:</strong> Dhoni's coolness and ability to back players under immense pressure is
                to the fore in Bangalore, where Bangladesh are beaten by one run during the World Twenty20. Dhoni helps
                India pull off an incredible heist.
            </li>
            <li><strong>January 4, 2017:</strong> Announces that he is giving up the captaincy, but remains available
                for selection for the upcoming England series.
